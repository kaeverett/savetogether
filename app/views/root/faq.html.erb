	<p><b>What is the SaveTogether concept?</b></p>

	<p>SaveTogether is a virtual community where individual donors can search, find, and agree to help match asset-targeted savings goals of low-income and distressed individuals. As this match is made, donors, savers, and our partner organizations are welcomed into a community based on open communication and mutual learning.</p>

	<p>The strategy is simple: identify savers participating in effective matched savings and financial education programs all across the country, and collect their stories on a powerful internet platform with the exciting outreach and transaction tools available today. Individual donors will take notice and join the asset building movement with both their funds and their energy.</p>
